## Booleans in C++

- In C++, `bool` is a data type representing a boolean value that can have two states: `true` or `false`.
- It is useful for conditions and logical operations, where you need to express whether something is true or false.
- The `bool` data type is part of the C++ Standard Library and is used extensively in C++ programming.

Here's an example of using `bool` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    bool isRaining = true;
    bool isSunny = false;

    // Print the boolean values
    std::cout << "Is it raining? " << isRaining << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is it sunny? " << isSunny << std::endl;

    // Use boolean variables in conditional statements
    if (isRaining) {
        std::cout << "You might need an umbrella!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No need for an umbrella today." << std::endl;
    }

    if (isSunny) {
        std::cout << "It's a sunny day!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "It's not sunny today." << std::endl;
    }

    // Perform logical operations
    bool hasMoney = true;
    bool hasCreditCard = false;

    bool canBuyItem = hasMoney || hasCreditCard;
    bool cannotBuyItem = !canBuyItem;

    std::cout << "Can buy item? " << canBuyItem << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Cannot buy item? " << cannotBuyItem << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Is it raining? 1
Is it sunny? 0
You might need an umbrella!
It's not sunny today.
Can buy item? 1
Cannot buy item? 0
```

- In the above code, we define two boolean variables `isRaining` and `isSunny`, and then use them in conditional statements to print appropriate messages. 
- We also demonstrate the use of logical operators (`||` for OR and `!` for NOT) to manipulate boolean values and store the results in other boolean variables.
